## Download

If you want a stable release of audiomass, suitable for common use and
packaging for Debian and Slackware distro, download here:
[Downloads](https://github.com/jeanslack/audiomass/releases)   

## Use

Have you installed all needed dependencies? Well!

**Examples:** 

Unzip the sources tarball of audiomass-cli, open a terminal 
window on its path-name and proceeded to convert a single audio file: 
`~$ ./audiomass-cli '/home/Name/my Music/audiofile.wav'`. 

Do you have many files with the same format to convert? then loads the 
folder that contains them and add the *-b* option (b = batch):
`~$ ./audiomass-cli -b '/home/Name/MyFolder/flac_files'`

For a shortcut help, type `audiomass-cli --help` or read the audiomass man page.

## Installation

audiomass-cli not require installation, but if you are interested build an 
installable package, see below:

**Debian:**

Extra dependencies for build package with distutils:
`~# apt-get install python-all python-stdeb fakeroot`

Enter in unzipped sources folder and type (with not root):
`~$ python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb`

This should create a python-pysplitcue_version_all.deb in the new deb_dist directory.

see the setup.py for more info on how-to build .deb package

**Slackware**

Is available a SlackBuild script to build a package *.tgz* for Slackware and Slackware based 
distributions. See here [pysplitcue.SlackBuild](https://github.com/jeanslack/slackbuilds/tree/master/audiomass)

Remember: install **pysetuptools** if not present first.
