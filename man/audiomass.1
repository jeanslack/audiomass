.SH DESCRIPTION

Audiomass is a command line audio wrapper of the Flac, Lame, Vorbis-tools,
Monkey's Audio, Shntool and FFmpeg libraries.
It supports conversions of different audio formats at a time and the ability
to convert even groups of files in a directory, saving the output in a specific
folder.

For each input file, audiomass-cli writes to a filename based on the input
filename, but with the extension changed to as appropriate to encoding.
